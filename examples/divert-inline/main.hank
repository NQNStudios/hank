This is a line that diverts -> part2

- (start)
This is a text line {if (seen_once>0) "-> second_route"} with a conditional divert in it.

- (seen_once) -> start

- (second_route) that can end in two different ways!
-> end1

- (part2) to another part of the script!
-> start

- (end1) Let's do something -> end2
- (end2) really really crazy -> end3
- (end3) and string together four lines with diverts -> end4
- (end4) just to see what would happen.
Wow.
