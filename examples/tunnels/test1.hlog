The dark grass is soft under your feet.
* Sleep
> 1:
You lie down and try to close your eyes.
You get attacked by a monster!
Then it is time to sleep.
You dream about even scarier monsters.
You wake as the sun rises.
* Eat something
* Make a move
> 1:
You're out of food! Soon you will starve to death.
It is time to move on.
